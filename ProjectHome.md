Syncronization made free and easy. No, seriously. This seems to be a difficult concept, I plan to make it an art.

TaoSync will be available in two versions. The first will be Windows only, and based on .NET 2.0. The second will be some variant of Java, and operational on all platforms (albeit, tested only on Linux and Java).
